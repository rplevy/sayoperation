      <p>SAY&Ouml;PERATION is an open <a href="http://github.com/rplevy/sayoperation" class="linkstyle1">source</a> game, built using <a href="http://clojure.org" class="linkstyle1">Clojure</a> and <a href="http://jquery.org" class="linkstyle1">JQuery</a>, for the purpose of collecting a corpus of natural language utterances that are causally linked to actions, so as to train a <a href="javascript:page('ml')" class="linkstyle1">probabilistic classifier</a> to pick up on the semantics of natural language within the limited domain of this game.  The first experiment is a very simple task (see below for instructions on how to play), but further levels with more complex (and even more fun for the participants) requirements are likely to be added for addtional machine learning experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player who initiates the game is presented with a board containing variously shaped/colored game pieces.  One of the pieces on the board is highlighted and one of the empty spaces is marked as a target.  Player 2 is presented with the same game board, but cannot see what piece to move or where the target is.  Player 1's challenge is to type an instruction to player 2 identifying the piece and the target location to move it to.  After Player 2 makes a move by dragging and dropping the piece to the hidden target, it is Player 2's turn.  Player 2 is presented with a highlighted game piece and a target that Player 1 can't see, and must type a description for Player 1 to enact.  The process is repeated until the players graduate to the next level.  Each successful move earns points for the team.  The global high score is constantly updated and displayed on the right-hand menu.

        Game-play tips:
        <ul>
          <li>Use simple and clear language, but speak grammatically.</li>
          <li>Don't use numbers or coordinates to describe locations.  That is cheating!  (It is too easy and not very interesting, so it is not allowed.)</li>
          <li>Please only type instructions into the text field.  I haven't added the chat box yet. :)</li>
        </ul>
